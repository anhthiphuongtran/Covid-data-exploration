# Explore Covid data using SQL and Tableau

## About
* The Covid-19 pandemic has resulted in a huge number of infected cases and deaths all around the world. Fortunately, since the popularity of vaccinations, the pandemic has been under control. This project will explore Covid data between the beginning of 2020 and mid-2021 to find out some statistical patterns that provide insight into pandemic's situations in each and every country. 

* First, this project is about data exploration using SQL. In particular, I will explore worldwide Covid data collected from websites [Our World In Data](https://ourworldindata.org/covid-deaths).
  
* Then, some important information will be elucidated with the aid of Tableau.

## Dependencies:
* SQL is required. Some SQL commands employed: SELECT, WHERE, ORDER BY, JOIN, PARTITION BY, CREATE TABLE, INSERT INTO, CREATE VIEW, etc.
* Tableau is also required for data visualisation. Here is the resulting [Covid Dashboard](https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/anh.tran5864/viz/CovidDashboard_17037384922620/Dashboard1?publish=yes).
