# Explore Covid data using SQL

## About
* The Covid-19 pandemic has resulted in a huge number of infected cases and deaths all around the world. Fortunately, since the popularity of vaccinations, the pandemic has been under control. This project will explore Covid data between 2020 and 2021 to find out some statistical patterns that provide insight into pandemic's situations in each and every country. 

* This project is about data exploration using SQL. In particular, I will explore worldwide Covid data collected from websites [Our World In Data](https://ourworldindata.org/covid-deaths).

## Dependencies:
* SQL is required.
* Some SQL commands employed: SELECT, WHERE, ORDER BY, JOIN, PARTITION BY, CREATE TABLE, INSERT INTO, CREATE VIEW, etc.
